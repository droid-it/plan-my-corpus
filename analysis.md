## Manual Calculation

### Step 1: Calculate Corpus at Retirement (2047)

**From Current Investments (₹2 Cr growing for 22 years at 14% pre-retirement):**
- FV = 2,00,00,000 × (1.14)^22 = ₹33.92 Cr

**From MF SIP (₹2L/month for 22 years at 14%):**
- Annual contribution = ₹24 L
- Using FV annuity formula: FV = PMT × [(1+r)^n - 1] / r
- FV = 24,00,000 × [(1.14)^22 - 1] / 0.14
- FV = 24,00,000 × 106.86 = ₹25.65 Cr

**From PPF (₹12,500/month for 12 years at 8%, then grows for 10 more years):**
- Annual contribution = ₹1.5 L
- FV after 12 years = 1,50,000 × [(1.08)^12 - 1] / 0.08 = ₹28.26 L
- Then grows for 10 more years: 28,26,000 × (1.08)^10 = ₹61.02 L

**Total Corpus at Retirement (before withdrawals):** ₹33.92 Cr + ₹25.65 Cr + ₹0.61 Cr = **₹60.18 Cr**

### Step 2: Calculate Goal Withdrawals Before Retirement

**Goals before 2047:**
1. Innova (2026): ₹36 L withdrawn, grows opportunity cost for 21 years @ 14%
   - Lost growth: 36 L × (1.14)^21 = ₹5.85 Cr

2. Ishaan's Marriage (2027): ₹7.87 L withdrawn, 20 years lost growth
   - Lost growth: 7.87 L × (1.14)^20 = ₹1.08 Cr

3. Luxury Car (2031): ₹1.28 Cr withdrawn, 16 years lost growth
   - Lost growth: 1.28 Cr × (1.14)^16 = ₹10.75 Cr

4. Yuvaan's Education (2040): ₹3.17 Cr withdrawn, 7 years lost growth
   - Lost growth: 3.17 Cr × (1.14)^7 = ₹8.04 Cr

5. Holiday Home (2046): ₹6.74 Cr withdrawn, 1 year lost growth
   - Lost growth: 6.74 Cr × (1.14)^1 = ₹7.68 Cr

**Total withdrawn (with lost growth):** ₹33.40 Cr

**Corpus at Retirement after goal withdrawals:** ₹60.18 Cr - ₹33.40 Cr = **₹26.78 Cr**

### Step 3: Calculate Retirement Corpus Required

Monthly expense at retirement: ₹2 L × (1.06)^22 = ₹7.37 L/month

For 25 years in retirement (300 months), with 12% post-retirement growth and 6% inflation:
- Real monthly rate = (12% - 6%) / 12 = 0.5% per month
- PV = 7,37,000 × [(1 - (1.005)^-300) / 0.005]
- PV = 7,37,000 × 155.21 = **₹11.44 Cr**

### Step 4: Check Goals After Retirement

**From remaining corpus of ₹26.78 Cr:**

6. Yavhi's Education (2047): ₹5.44 Cr
   - Remaining: ₹21.34 Cr

7. Yuvaan's Marriage (2050): ₹4.29 Cr
   - But corpus grows for 3 years: ₹21.34 Cr × (1.12)^3 = ₹29.98 Cr
   - After withdrawal: ₹25.69 Cr

8. Yahvi's Marriage (2055): ₹5.74 Cr
   - Corpus grows for 5 more years: ₹25.69 Cr × (1.12)^5 = ₹45.26 Cr
   - After withdrawal: ₹39.52 Cr

**Final corpus after all goals:** ₹39.52 Cr

## Analysis Result

✅ **All goals are FUNDED**
✅ **Retirement corpus is ADEQUATE**

**At retirement (2047):**
- Corpus available: ₹26.78 Cr
- Required for retirement: ₹11.44 Cr
- Required for remaining goals: ₹5.44 Cr (Yavhi's education)
- **Surplus: ₹9.90 Cr**

**After all goals (2055):**
- Remaining corpus: ₹39.52 Cr

## Why App Might Show Shortfall

The app might be showing a shortfall due to:

1. **Different inflation assumptions** - App might be using default 6% for all categories
2. **Life expectancy assumption** - If app assumes longer retirement (e.g., 85-90 years)
3. **Calculation timing** - When exactly withdrawals are accounted for
4. **Missing expense inflation category** - Check if expense inflation category is set

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Your plan is well-funded with good surplus
2. Consider increasing good-to-have goals or adding new goals
3. Your 22-year investment horizon with ₹2L/month SIP is powerful
4. The ₹2 Cr current investments give you a strong foundation
5. PPF provides tax-advantaged conservative growth

## Key Success Factors

- Long investment horizon (22 years to retirement)
- High monthly contributions (₹2.125 L)
- Strong current portfolio (₹2 Cr)
- Equity-heavy allocation (good for long-term growth)
- Realistic expense expectations (₹2 L/month)
